# Map
I can maybe put a marker on every one of the rooms, and on tapping, request the api with the room realtime. 

we'll do a total one for on-load appearance, and will stop update. that's for the overall. 

And then on each marks, you can click on them to get the sorta-latest version of the data. 

Maybe later.
